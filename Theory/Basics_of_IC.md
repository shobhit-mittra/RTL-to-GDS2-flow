# Basics of Integrated-Circuits(IC) :

This first section of the course serves as an introduction to VLSI and the world of semiconductor ICs' that surrounds us in the form of electronic devices. 


## VLSI : A Historic Perspective

Prior to the inception of ICs and the domain of VLSI, the earliest of the devices were engineered and designed by the interconnection of numerous discrete active* (diode, transistor) and passive* (resistor, capacitor, inductor) components.

> Active components are the one's that require a source of energy to perform their functionality and passive components do not require any source of energy. 

The issue with such method of creating devices is the nexus of these discrete components becomes expensive, time-consuming and unreliable. In order to counter this issue, a technology was developed in the 1960s' namely : 'Integrated Circuit(IC)'. 

ICs' are monolithic silicon chip that contains several components on the chip. Monolithic in this context refers to the material composition for the base chip is homogenous i.e Silicon and only a single crystal is used. The transistors are realised on this single crystal of silicon itself rather than combining discrete components together.

One of the standard methodology to realise transistors on a silicon chip is Photolithography.

In response to the surge in the demand for ICs' due to the quest for higher computation and data storage, the number of transistors packaged on a single chip also increased. This led to the increase in the scale of integration to the point where millions of transistors are integrated on a single chip. This advancement paved way for the domain of Very-Large-Scale-Integration (VLSI). 

The incrementation of packaging density for every new generation of a chip is due to the advancement in the technology node of transistors used in the pacakaging of the chip. Technology node or simply Technology, in this context, refers to the distance between the source and the drain that essentially forms the conducting channel in the transistor for flow of current. Advanced technology nodes have a smaller channel length that makes it possible to shrink the tranistor size and contribute to a higher number of transistor count onto a chip essentially increasing the packaging density.
