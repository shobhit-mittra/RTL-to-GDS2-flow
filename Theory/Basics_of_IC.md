# Basics of Integrated-Circuits(IC) :

This first section of the course serves as an introduction to VLSI and the world of semiconductor ICs' that surrounds us in the form of electronic devices. 


## VLSI : A Hestoric Perspective

Prior to the inception of ICs and the domain of VLSI, the earliest of the devices were engineered and designed by the interconnection of numerous discrete active (diode, transistor) and passive (resistor, capacitor, inductor) components.

> [!NOTE]
> Active components are the one's that require a source of energy to perform their functionality and passive components do not require any source of energy.
