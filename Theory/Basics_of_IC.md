# Basics of Integrated-Circuits(IC) :

This first section of the course serves as an introduction to VLSI and the world of semiconductor ICs' that surrounds us in the form of electronic devices. 


## VLSI : A Historic Perspective

Prior to the inception of ICs and the domain of VLSI, the earliest of the devices were engineered and designed by the interconnection of numerous discrete active* (diode, transistor) and passive* (resistor, capacitor, inductor) components.

> [!NOTE]
> Active components are the one's that require a source of energy to perform their functionality and passive components do not require any source of energy. 

The issue with such method of creating devices is the nexus of these discrete components becomes expensive, time-consuming and unreliable. In order to counter this issue, a technology was developed in the 1960s' namely : 'Integrated Circuit(IC)'. 

ICs' are monolithic silicon chip that contains several components on the chip. Monolithic in this context refers to the material composition for the base chip is homogenous i.e Silicon and only a single crystal is used. The transistors are realised on this single crystal of silicon itself rather than combining discrete components together.
