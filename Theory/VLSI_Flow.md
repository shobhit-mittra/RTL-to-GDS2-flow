# Overview of VLSI-Design Flow :

After covering the [basic concepts of IC](../Theory/Basics_of_IC.md), we move onto explore the VLSI-Design flow in detail and all the related concepts. 


## VLSI Flow : A top-level view

The journey of a design starting from it's ideation all the way to fabrication of the chip is one that is long and tedious.

It is wise to utilize the technique of *divide-and-conquer* to familiarize and comprehend this wonderful flow. As the name suggests, divide-and-conquer involves breaking down the flow into smaller and simpler segments. A big upside to this ordeal is that it becomes even more apparent how each segment interacts with one another and their influence on eachother - Like carrying out optimization in early stages of the design-flow can lead to other stages down the flow to become more managable and hence improving efficiency.
