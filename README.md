# RTL-to-GDS2-flow
This repository is my attempt to get a hands-on-experience on the VLSI flow using Open-Source EDA tools. Inspired by the phenomenal course of Dr. Sneh Saurabh sir (IIIT-D Professor), I attempt to use the knowledge in the course and keep updating the repo. as I progress through the course.

The repositry is organised into 2 segments namely, Theory and Tutorial(Hands-on-work) for the sake of proper organization of my learnings as I progress through the course. Hence, the index is as under :
- [Theory](Theory) : Check for the [README.md](Theory/README.md) in the theory directory for the index of how the theory is organized.
- [Tutorials](Tutorials.md)
